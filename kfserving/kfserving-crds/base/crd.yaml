                                this is not provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME)
                                are expanded using the container''s environment. If
                                a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the

                                can be escaped with a double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME).
                                Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless
                                of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated.

                                    is not called if the container crashes or exits.
                                    The reason for termination is passed to the handler.
                                    The Pod''s termination grace period countdown
                                    begins before the PreStop hooked is executed.
                                    Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                                    of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                    or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                      Behaves similarly to SubPath but environment
                                      variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded
                                      using the container's environment. Defaults
                                      to "" (volume's root). SubPathExpr and SubPath
                                      are mutually exclusive. This field is beta in
